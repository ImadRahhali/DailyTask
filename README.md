# DailyTask

DailyTask is a robust ToDo application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend leverages AWS services for a serverless architecture, including AWS S3 for hosting static content, AWS DynamoDB for storing tasks, AWS Lambda for function execution, and AWS API Gateway for managing endpoints and connecting Lambda functions with the DynamoDB table.
